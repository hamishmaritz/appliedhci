        we can see that no one particular method was perfect; each method had its unique drawbacks. Examples of this would be: AirDrop, although seemingly the fastest and most efficient for iOS users, our results showed that it was slower than Facebook Messenger. Furthermore, AirDrop is limited to iOS devices only, meaning Android users are unable to receive and send files via this method. Meanwhile, Facebook Messenger was unable to maintain the original image quality and therefore sent a slightly lower quality version of the image and required both sender and recipient to have established a connection online with each other via friend or message request. Participants in the study did not seem too interested in any of the other given methods except for one outlier using Email, which took significantly longer than the different two ways but sent the image in its original, unaltered state.

        We can see from our experiment that Facebook Messenger was the most popular method of file sharing amongst our sample size of 15. We found that what people often associated with their “most efficient” means of file sharing mostly correlated with their familiarity with the method itself. As stated earlier in our analysis, Facebook Messenger in New Zealand is one of the largest platforms of social media, so it no surprise that 60% preferred to use Facebook Messenger over other methods, despite the compression of the images. It is also likely that users did not care about the compression of the image, as the image we asked them to share was a stock image pulled off of Google Images that maintained no sentimental value.

        Upon completing our experiments, we realized that we had not considered the Hawthorne effect, which states that subjects may behave differently when they are aware that they are being observed. As a result of this, we realize that some of the results may vary to real-life applications due to being under examining the condition. However, our sample size of 15 should
give us slightly more accurate results than if we were to go with smaller sample size.
