        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, we can see from our results that Facebook messenger was the most popular method of file sharing amongst our sample of 15. 
          <br></br>We found that what people often associated with their “most efficient” method of file sharing largely correlated with their familiarity with the method itself.</p> 
          <p> As stated earlier in our analysis, Facebook Messenger in New Zealand is one of the largest platforms of social media, so it it no surprise that XYZ% preferred to use Facebook Messenger over other methods, despite the compression of the images.</p>
          <p> It is also likely that users did not care about the compression of the image, as the image we asked them to share was a stock image pulled off of Google Images that maintained no sentimental value.</p>
