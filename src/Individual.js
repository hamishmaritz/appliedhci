        <p>Through this assignment I have learnt a lot about various aspects of Human Computer Interaction. It is through this that I have learnt that while it is similar to User Centered Design it is also very different in other aspects.
        </p>
        <p>In This Assignment we went over what file sharing method is the most common, and what is it the most effective. From this project I learnt that a lot of our users used Messenger as it was the most simple and quickest way of sharing photos effectively. </p>
        <p>Through this assessment I have had a lot of my understanding from my own research into testing other people confirmed and through this class my ability to test other people has grown. Through our testing we gathered results and used a method called Experimental Data Analysis through a controlled experiment. Through this assessment I feel as though my understanding of testing methods have grown and been further developed. </p>
        <p>In this assessment my role was mainly as an interviewer and the person who collected answers that were given. In addition I used the data that we collected as a team to create various graphs for the experimental data Analysis. Through this I was able to use my previous experience in studying user results from my studies in Research and Development project to help analysis the data we collected.
        </p>
        <p>Overall I enjoyed my role in this project and took the advantages provided to me through the Applied Human Computer Interaction paper to build upon my learnings as a Network Security Major student as well as to broaden my understanding of Human Computer Interaction . Overall I found that this paper has helped my understanding and has aided me in further understanding my own Research And Development Project.</p>

        <p>From this assignment, I have learned to question more when it comes to human interaction around technology. Using technology daily and not asking how it functions is something that we tend to brush over and expect it to work without a second thought. Applied Human-Computer Interaction has taught me that there is more when it comes to the interfaces between humans and computers.

        <p>Having previous experience in creating websites, I opted to work primarily on developing the site. Taking a non-traditional approach and instead, using a more modern framework allowed for easier integration with the data we had procured. Using React and Azure for the website linked with a Github Repository allowed for each member to contribute into that repository that would automatically update the site. The other role that I had was in the gathering of data alongside Joshua and Michael.  We were able to gather data from AUT Students who were willing to participate as well as external sources outside of the university for a more in-depth data analysis where it would possibly fluctuate due to different circumstances.</p>
        <p>Having worked with both Joshua and Michael in Assignment 1 allowed for a smooth group process since the foundation was already there. Communication, teamwork, and knowing how we all meshed meant that I was able to put trust into each group member and not worry about minor details that are faced when new groups are introduced. Working with Joshua also allowed me to gain a new understanding of Usability Testing since he had prior experience in it. This allowed me to question Joshua on what he knew and for him to give me a better understanding through oral communication rather than just textbooks and online resources.</p>
        <p>I'm very fortunate to have taken Applied Human-Computer Interaction as what I have learned has translated towards a different thinking for myself. I've been able to meet other students at different universities whom have taken similar papers and have been able to hold conversations and debate on what our understands of Applied HCI is and the theory behind it, which I think is fantastic. I wouldn't have thought I would have learned as much as I have when I first started this paper, but the interaction sessions have been one of the key things that I look forward to each week as it provokes an entirely different thought process from how I would typically think.</p>
